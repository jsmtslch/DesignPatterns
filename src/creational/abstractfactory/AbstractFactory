For example, imagine we have two authors, Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Darwin, 
both looking to publish their (arguably) most famous works, The Raven and 
On the Origin of Species, respectively. Since one is a poet and the other a scientist, 
the types of work they’ve created are quite different (poem and research paper). 
Moreover, given those disparate types of writings, it’s unlikely that they’ll both be using 
the same publisher. As it happens, The Raven was first published in 1845 by a periodical called
 The American Review, while On the Origin of Species was published in 1859 by John Murray, 
 an eclectic English publishing firm.

Since different types of authors produces different kinds of writing — which are likely to 
be published by dramatically different publishers — this is a great use of the abstract 
factory method. To simplify our comparison, we’ll modernize the publisher types a bit and 
use a blog for publishing poems and a scientific journal for publishing research papers. 
If we have a poem like The Raven ready to be published, we need an appropriate type of 
publisher for it, such as a Blog. Similarly, a scientific paper, like On the Origin of Species, 
might require a scientific journal for publication.
